PROMPT 3 GOAL
Build the frontend Compliance Review page and components.
Use existing React, Tailwind, shadcn/ui patterns in the repo.
Assume APIs exist from Prompt 2.

Page requirements
Create route/page: /compliance-review

Top controls
- Frequency toggle: Daily / Weekly
- Site selector dropdown (loads /api/work-sites)
- Participant selector dropdown (loads /api/participants)
- Date picker for Daily
- Week selector (or auto week range) for Weekly

Behavior
A) Site checklist
- When site selected + frequency chosen:
  - fetch the appropriate template(s) for SITE + frequency
  - allow user to Start or Resume a run:
     - if run exists for that site and date/week, load it
     - else create run via POST /api/compliance-runs then load

B) Participant checklist
- When participant selected + frequency chosen:
  - fetch templates for PARTICIPANT + frequency
  - Start/Resume similarly

Checklist rendering
- For each item:
  - show title
  - show optional guidance text in subtle style
  - render input control based on responseType:
    - YES/NO/NA buttons
    - number input
    - textarea for text
    - photo upload button for PHOTO_REQUIRED (use existing upload component if exists)
  - notes field optional for all items

Autosave
- On change, debounce-save to /api/compliance-runs/:id/respond

Submit
- Submit button calls /api/compliance-runs/:id/submit
- After submit show summary banner:
  - Green/Amber/Red status
  - list failed critical items
  - list created actions

Actions panel
- Right side panel showing open actions for selected site/participant:
  - fetch /api/compliance-actions?siteId=... and/or participantId=...
  - show status, severity, due date
  - allow “Mark In Progress” and “Close” if role allows (close requires notes, optional photo)

UX requirements
- Keep layout clean, calm, and consistent with your dark-accented theme.
- Provide meaningful success/error toasts.

Deliverables
- Page works end-to-end
- Staff can complete a site daily run and submit it
- Actions appear after submission
- No template editing UI required yet (admin can use existing admin routes or we add later)
