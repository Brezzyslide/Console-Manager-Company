Build a minimalist landing page for the product called “Need2Comply AI+” and link it to the existing login page.

Goal
Create a simple, modern landing page that is not wordy, feels calm and professional, and matches the NeedsCare Safeguard UI style (light surfaces, deep muted blue accents). It should clearly position Need2Comply AI+ as a must-have for NDIS providers to stay audit ready and compliant.

Key requirements
- Add a new public route: /
- Keep the existing login page and route unchanged.
- Landing page must include:
  1) “Log in” button that routes to the existing login page
  2) “Contact us” button for new buyers (opens a modal or routes to /contact)
- If a user is already authenticated, show “Go to Dashboard” instead of “Log in”.
- Minimal text. Strong bullet points. No long paragraphs.
- Use existing shadcn/ui components and the project’s theme tokens. Do not hardcode random colours.
- The page should be responsive: desktop + mobile.
- No external dependencies required.

Information architecture (content)
Landing copy must be short and structured like this:

HERO
- Title: Need2Comply AI+
- Subtitle: “Always audit ready. Without the scramble.”
- One line description: “Daily compliance and governance for NDIS providers.”
- Primary CTA: Log in / Go to Dashboard
- Secondary CTA: Contact us

SECTIONS (very short)
1) The problem (2 lines max)
- “Audits fail when evidence is late, scattered, or unclear.”
- “Need2Comply AI+ keeps it current, in one place.”

2) What it does (bullets)
- Keeps compliance up to date, every day
- Captures evidence as work happens
- Maintains required registers in one place
- Surfaces risks and actions early
- Keeps you audit ready year-round

3) Built for NDIS (bullets)
- SIL and site based services
- Participant and site oversight
- Governance and board reporting
- Aligned with NDIS expectations

4) Why auditors trust it (bullets)
- Evidence is current
- Decisions are traceable
- Oversight is visible
- Improvement is documented

FOOTER
- Short line: “Compliance, without chaos.”
- Small links: Privacy, Terms (can be placeholders)

Design direction
- Minimalist layout with lots of whitespace
- Use cards for the bullet sections (3–4 cards max)
- Deep muted blue for headings/CTAs, warm off-white background
- Subtle borders, soft radius, no loud shadows, no gradients
- Include a small brand mark placeholder at top left:
  - If you already have a logo component or SVG, use it.
  - Otherwise render a simple mark (rounded square outline + check) as placeholder.

Routing
- Ensure "/" renders LandingPage.
- Ensure login route remains as-is (do not break auth).
- Add a “Log in” button on landing that links to the existing login route (e.g. /login).
- If authenticated, replace button with “Go to Dashboard” linking to the main app route.

Contact Us
Implement a simple contact flow suitable for early sales:
Option A (preferred): Modal form on landing
Fields:
- Name
- Organisation
- Email
- Phone (optional)
- Message
Buttons:
- Send enquiry
- Cancel
Backend:
- POST /api/contact-enquiry
Store in DB table: contact_enquiries (companyId nullable, since public)
Fields:
- id
- name, organisation, email, phone, message
- source = "landing"
- status = NEW | RESPONDED
- createdAt
Also show a success toast: “Enquiry sent. We’ll get back to you.”

If you already have an email sending service configured, you can send an email notification to an admin inbox. If not, just store it and create an admin-only list view later.

Implementation steps
1) Create LandingPage component under src/app/landing or src/pages/landing (match repo conventions).
2) Add route "/" to render LandingPage.
3) Add auth-aware CTA:
   - If session exists: show “Go to Dashboard”
   - Else: show “Log in”
4) Add Contact modal form and API endpoint + DB storage.
5) Style everything using shadcn components and theme tokens:
   - Button variants: default primary and outline secondary
   - Cards for sections
   - Use consistent spacing and typography sizes

Acceptance criteria
- Landing page loads at "/"
- Login route still works
- “Log in” navigates to existing login page
- Authenticated users see “Go to Dashboard”
- Contact modal submits successfully and stores enquiry
- Page is clean, minimal, responsive, and not wordy
