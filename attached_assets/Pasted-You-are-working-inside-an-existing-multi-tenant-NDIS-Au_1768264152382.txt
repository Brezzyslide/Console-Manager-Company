You are working inside an existing multi-tenant NDIS Audit System.

Objective
After a document is reviewed and scored (Document Quality Score – DQS),
the system must intelligently SUGGEST an appropriate finding to the auditor,
without automatically determining or creating a finding.

Critical constraint
- The system must NEVER auto-create a finding.
- The auditor must always explicitly confirm or override.
- Existing conformance states, scoring logic, and audit runner flow must remain unchanged.

Context
Document reviews occur within Evidence Requests, which are linked to:
- auditId (always)
- indicatorAssessmentId (required for this feature)
- optional findingId (if remediation evidence)

Each DocumentReview produces:
- dqsPercent (0–100)
- criticalFailuresCount (integer)
- decision (ACCEPT / REJECT)
- reviewerComments

Implementation requirements

A) Trigger point
Run the suggestion logic immediately after a DocumentReview is saved
(only when decision = ACCEPT or REJECT).

B) Determine suggestion band
Using DocumentReview data, compute a SuggestedFindingType:

Rules:
1. If decision = REJECT
   → SuggestedFindingType = MINOR_NC
   → Flag severity = HIGH

2. If criticalFailuresCount > 0
   → If indicatorAssessment.isCritical = true
        SuggestedFindingType = MAJOR_NC
     Else
        SuggestedFindingType = MINOR_NC

3. Else if dqsPercent < 50
   → SuggestedFindingType = MINOR_NC
   → Flag severity = HIGH

4. Else if dqsPercent >= 50 AND dqsPercent < 70
   → SuggestedFindingType = MINOR_NC
   → Flag severity = MEDIUM

5. Else if dqsPercent >= 70 AND dqsPercent < 85
   → SuggestedFindingType = OBSERVATION
   → Flag severity = LOW

6. Else if dqsPercent >= 85
   → SuggestedFindingType = NONE
   → No finding suggested

C) Suggested finding record (non-binding)
Create a SuggestedFinding object (do NOT create a real Finding):

Fields:
- tenantId/companyId
- auditId
- indicatorAssessmentId
- evidenceRequestId
- documentReviewId
- suggestedType (OBSERVATION / MINOR_NC / MAJOR_NC)
- rationaleText (auto-generated, see below)
- createdAt

D) Auto-generate rationaleText
Generate a short, neutral explanation using this template:

"Based on document review scoring:
- Document Quality Score: {dqsPercent}%
- Critical checklist failures: {criticalFailuresCount}
- Review decision: {decision}

The evidence may not sufficiently demonstrate conformance for this indicator."

Do NOT use accusatory or definitive language.

E) UI behaviour (Indicator Assessment screen)
When a SuggestedFinding exists and is unresolved:

- Display a non-blocking banner:
  “Evidence review suggests a {SuggestedFindingType}. Please confirm.”

- Show action buttons:
  - Create Observation
  - Create Minor NC
  - Create Major NC (only if indicatorAssessment.isCritical = true)
  - Dismiss suggestion (requires optional justification text)

F) Auditor interaction rules
- Clicking a button explicitly creates a real Finding and links:
  - finding.indicatorAssessmentId
  - finding.evidenceRequestId
  - finding.documentReviewId
- Dismissing a suggestion must store:
  - dismissedByUserId
  - dismissedReason (optional but recommended)
  - dismissedAt

G) Safeguards (consistency, not control)
1. If SuggestedFindingType exists AND
   indicatorAssessment.conformanceOutcome = CONFORMANCE
   THEN:
   - Require auditor to either accept or dismiss the suggestion
   - OR provide a short justification before finalising the indicator

2. No scoring values are changed automatically by this feature.

H) Tenancy and permissions
- All records must be tenant/company scoped.
- Only users with audit review permissions can act on suggestions.
- Read-only users can view suggestion banners but cannot act.

Deliverables
1. Backend logic for SuggestedFinding generation
2. Storage model for SuggestedFinding
3. UI banner + actions on Indicator Assessment view
4. Confirmation that:
   - No findings are auto-created
   - Scoring engine is untouched
   - Auditor judgement remains authoritative
