Replit Prompt: Update Provider Portal Dashboard to Reflect Sprint 3 Audit Plan (No Mock Data)

Context
You are working in an existing monorepo app:
- Frontend: Vite + React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind + shadcn/ui + Wouter
- Backend: Express on same port (5000)
- DB: Postgres + Drizzle
- Strict multi tenancy + RBAC already exists
- Sprint 3 audit engine exists (audits, scope, templates, findings)
- Requirement: DO NOT add mock or seeded demo data. Only display real data if it exists, otherwise show empty state text like “No audits yet”.

Goal
Update the Provider Portal Dashboard (the screen shown in screenshot) so it reflects our Sprint 3 plan:
- Remove “Services coming soon” and “Schedule coming soon”
- Replace them with cards and panels that surface:
  - Audits (Internal + External pathway entry lives under /audits, not on dashboard)
  - Compliance Scope (line items selected for this provider)
  - Findings overview (open findings counts)
  - Readiness/last audit summary
- Keep the same dark accent styling and calm tone used currently

What the dashboard must show after change
Top row should still be 4 cards, but update them to:
1) Provider Portal (keep)
   - Subtitle: “NDIS compliance and audit workspace”
   - Small line: show onboarding status if available (Completed or In progress)

2) Your Role (keep)
   - Keep role label, plus optional small text: “Audit access enabled”

3) Audits (NEW replaces Services)
   - Primary text:
     - If there is an active audit (DRAFT, IN_PROGRESS, IN_REVIEW): show “1 Active Audit” (or count)
     - Else show “No Active Audits”
   - Secondary text: “Create internal or external audits”
   - Button: “Create Audit” linking to /audits/new
   - Secondary link: “View audits” linking to /audits

4) Compliance Scope (NEW replaces Schedule)
   - Primary text: “X Line Items in Scope”
     - X comes from company_service_selections join support_line_items where active
   - Secondary text: “Services being audited”
   - Link: “View scope” which opens a simple read only panel or routes to /onboarding step 2 or a new /scope page
   - If zero line items selected, show: “Scope not set” with link to /onboarding

Under cards, replace “Getting Started” panel with “Compliance Overview”
Compliance Overview panel (wide)
- Show 3 compact rows:
  - Audit readiness: 
    - If onboarding not completed -> “Not ready (complete onboarding)”
    - Else -> “Ready for internal audit”
  - Last audit:
    - If none -> “No audits ye
