Extend the existing "Register" module by adding Governance Registers required for NDIS compliance and audit readiness.

Registers to add:
1) Risk Register
2) Continuous Improvement Register
3) Policy Update Register
4) Legislative Register (auto-populated on first creation)

System constraints
- Multi-tenant system: enforce companyId scoping everywhere.
- Registers are evidence-grade records (auditable, timestamped).
- No destructive deletes; use soft delete where needed.
- Only Admin / TeamLeader roles can close records.
- Staff may create and update where permitted.
- Minimalist UI consistent with NeedsCare Safeguard AI+ design system.

------------------------------------------------------------
1) RISK REGISTER
------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
Track organisational, site, and participant-related risks with clear controls, ratings, and review cycles.

Database: risk_register
Fields:
- id, companyId
- riskTitle (text)
- riskDescription (text)
- riskCategory (enum:
   SAFETY, CLINICAL, MEDICATION, BEHAVIOUR, WORKFORCE, GOVERNANCE,
   INFORMATION_PRIVACY, FINANCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, OTHER
 )
- scopeType (enum: ORGANISATIONAL, SITE, PARTICIPANT)
- siteId nullable
- participantId nullable
- likelihood (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- consequence (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
- riskRating (enum: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXTREME) // derived but stored
- existingControls (text)
- additionalControlsRequired (text nullable)
- ownerUserId
- reviewFrequency (enum: MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, ANNUAL)
- nextReviewDate
- status (enum: OPEN, MITIGATING, ACCEPTED, CLOSED)
- closedAt nullable
- createdByUserId
- createdAt, updatedAt

Logic
- riskRating auto-calculated using likelihood x consequence matrix
- HIGH/EXTREME risks must always have nextReviewDate
- Closing requires review notes

UI
- Matrix badge (colour coded but muted)
- Filters: category, scope, rating, status
- Detail view with history timeline

------------------------------------------------------------
2) CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT REGISTER
------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
Capture learning from incidents, audits, complaints, feedback, and reviews.

Database: continuous_improvement_register
Fields:
- id, companyId
- improvementTitle
- source (enum:
   INCIDENT, COMPLAINT, AUDIT, SELF_ASSESSMENT, STAFF_FEEDBACK,
   PARTICIPANT_FEEDBACK, FAMILY_FEEDBACK, OTHER
 )
- relatedRegisterType (enum nullable:
   INCIDENT, COMPLAINT, RISK, AUDIT, POLICY
 )
- relatedRecordId nullable
- description (text)
- improvementActions (text)
- responsibleUserId
- targetCompletionDate
- status (enum: OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED)
- outcomeSummary nullable
- completedAt nullable
- evidenceAttachmentIds nullable (json)
- createdByUserId
- createdAt, updatedAt

Rules
- COMPLETED requires outcomeSummary
- Used as evidence for Practice Standard: Continuous Improvement

UI
- Kanban-style status (optional later)
- Simple list + detail view initially
- Link back to originating register where applicable

------------------------------------------------------------
3) POLICY UPDATE REGISTER
------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
Track creation, review, approval, and implementation of policies.

Database: policy_update_register
Fields:
- id, companyId
- policyName
- policyCategory (enum:
   GOVERNANCE, SAFEGUARDS, INCIDENT_MANAGEMENT, MEDICATION,
   RESTRICTIVE_PRACTICE, PRIVACY, WORKFORCE, EMERGENCY, OTHER
 )
- version (text)
- changeSummary (text)
- reasonForUpdate (enum:
   LEGISLATIVE_CHANGE, INCIDENT, AUDIT_FINDING, SCHEDULED_REVIEW, OTHER
 )
- approvalRequired (boolean)
- approvedByUserId nullable
- approvalDate nullable
- effectiveDate
- reviewDueDate
- staffNotified (boolean default false)
- implementationNotes nullable
- status (enum: DRAFT, APPROVED, IMPLEMENTED, ARCHIVED)
- createdByUserId
- createdAt, updatedAt

Rules
- APPROVED requires approvedByUserId + approvalDate
- IMPLEMENTED requires effectiveDate
- Used as evidence for governance & policy controls

------------------------------------------------------------
4) LEGISLATIVE REGISTER (AUTO-POPULATED)
------------------------------------------------------------

Purpose
Maintain awareness of applicable legislation and regulatory obligations.

Database: legislative_register
Fields:
- id, companyId
- legislationName
- jurisdiction (enum: FEDERAL, STATE)
- authority (text) // e.g. NDIS Commission, Victorian Govt
- description (text)
- applicableTo (enum:
   ALL_PROVIDERS, SIL_ONLY, BEHAVIOUR_SUPPORT, MEDICATION, WORKFORCE
 )
- lastReviewedDate
- reviewNotes nullable
- linkedPolicies (json nullable)
- status (enum: CURRENT, UNDER_REVIEW, SUPERSEDED)
- createdAt, updatedAt

Auto-population logic (critical)
When the first Legislative Register is accessed for a tenant:
- Seed the register with the following CURRENT NDIS-relevant legislation:

FEDERAL:
- National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013
- NDIS (Provider Registration and Practice Standards) Rules 2018
- NDIS Code of Conduct
- NDIS (Incident Management and Reportable Incidents) Rules 2018
- NDIS (Restrictive Practices and Behaviour Support) Rules 2018
- Privacy Act 1988 (incl. APPs)

STATE (Victoria):
- Disability Act 2006 (Vic)
- Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic)
- Children, Youth and Families Act 2005 (Vic) (if applicable)
- Occupational Health and Safety Act 2004 (Vic)
- Health Records Act 2001 (Vic)

Each entry must include:
- short plain-language description
- applicableTo mapping
- status = CURRENT

This seeding runs ONCE per tenant.

------------------------------------------------------------
COMMON UX RULES FOR ALL REGISTERS
------------------------------------------------------------

Register Home
- Display cards for:
  Evacuation Drill
  Complaints
  Risk
  Continuous Improvement
  Policy Updates
  Legislative

When a register is opened:
- Show an instruction panel explaining:
  purpose
  what auditors expect
  who should update it

Permissions
- Staff: create + edit open items
- TeamLeader/Admin: close, approve, archive
- Legislative Register: Admin edit only

Backend APIs
- Standard CRUD per register
- GET /api/registers/{type}
- POST /api/registers/{type}
- PATCH /api/registers/{type}/:id
- Soft delete where applicable

Quality bar
- Neutral language, no placeholders
- Dates required where governance expects them
- Every closed record must have rationale
- Styling uses existing design tokens only

Deliverables
- DB migrations
- Seed logic for Legislative Register
- API routes with RBAC
- UI pages + instruction panels
- Registers visible under unified Register module
