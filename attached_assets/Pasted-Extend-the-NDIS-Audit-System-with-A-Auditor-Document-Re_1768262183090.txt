Extend the NDIS Audit System with:
A) Auditor Document Review Checklist (appears only during review)
B) Provider Upload Link page with tips on what auditors look for

Constraints:
- Do NOT change Audit Runner flow
- Do NOT replace conformance scoring
- Keep evidence request lifecycle intact (REQUESTED, SUBMITTED, REVIEWED/ACCEPTED/REJECTED)
- Multi tenancy enforced on every read/write (tenant/companyId)

A) Auditor checklist (review-time only)
1. Add DocumentType selection on each submitted evidence document (POLICY, PROCEDURE, CARE_PLAN, QUALIFICATION, CLEARANCE, TRAINING_RECORD, SUPERVISION, ROSTER_TIMESHEET, INVOICE_CLAIM, INCIDENT_RECORD, COMPLAINT_RECORD, RISK_ASSESSMENT)
2. Add checklist templates per DocumentType:
   - universal hygiene items
   - implementation evidence items
   - critical content checks (flagged isCritical)
3. Add DocumentReview record linked to evidence document:
   - tenantId, auditId, evidenceRequestId, evidenceDocumentId
   - reviewerUserId
   - responses: { key, value YES/NO/PARTLY/NA }
   - dqsPercent, criticalFailuresCount
   - decision: ACCEPT / REJECT
   - comments (required if REJECT)
   - createdAt
4. UI: In Evidence Request review screen, when status is SUBMITTED/RESUBMITTED:
   - show checklist
   - compute DQS live
   - show suggested outcome banner (informational only)
   - if auditor marks ACCEPT but criticalFailuresCount > 0, require a short justification text
   - store review record and set evidence status to ACCEPTED or REJECTED

B) Provider upload link + tips
1. Create secure upload link endpoint:
   - tokenized, expires
   - scoped to tenantId + auditId + evidenceRequestId (and optional findingId)
2. Provider page shows:
   - request title, description, due date, domain tag
   - document type dropdown
   - “What we look for” tips panel that updates based on document type
   - upload control (multiple files allowed if required)
3. On upload:
   - store evidence document(s) under the evidence request
   - set status to SUBMITTED or RESUBMITTED
   - notify auditor (in-app notification if exists)

C) Domain integration
- EvidenceRequest already has auditId and optional findingId; add domainId/domainCode field if not present.
- Provider page displays the domain name.
- Auditor review queue can filter by domain.

Deliverables:
- DB migration
- API routes
- Frontend pages/components
- Backwards compatible: existing evidence requests still work with null reviews
